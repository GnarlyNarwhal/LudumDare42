# Ludum Dare 42

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Must have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html) installed
* NOTE: I run Java 10 so I cannot guarantee that it will work on earlier version, but I don't believe I've used anything preventing it from running on some older versions. Click [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html) to download Java 10.

Graphics driver must have support for OpenGL 3.3 Core or later

### What's this all about?
This project is my game for Ludum Dare 42. If you don't know what [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/about) is and you're into making games then definitely check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/about).

### So what's the game?
You are the Java Garbage Collecter and the JVM is running out of heap space. Can you stop it in time?

### Can I play it?
Of course! Here's how:

Click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XMUZP49DxGE8KB5OEtUxoEArjhHcM4Ju) to download the game. Once you've downloaded it extract the zip file and run the jar file.

Of course you can always download the source and compile it yourself. You are going to need [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/download). Make sure to include JOML under **Addons**
